# AI-ECommerce-Analytics-Platform
AI-Enhanced Cloud-Based E-Commerce Analytics Platform with Predictive Insights and NLP-Driven Customer Experience
Project Overview
The AI-Enhanced Cloud-Based E-Commerce Analytics Platform is a comprehensive, cloud-native solution that leverages artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) to provide real-time data analytics, customer insights, and predictive modeling for e-commerce. The platform is built on a microservices architecture with Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and resilience. By utilizing cutting-edge technologies like Apache Spark, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face Transformers, this platform provides predictive insights that enhance customer segmentation, demand forecasting, fraud detection, and customer experience through NLP-driven analysis.
    
Key Features

    - Kubernetes: Set up Kubernetes for orchestration.
    - Python: Install Python 3.8+ if not already available.
    - Other Tools: Git, Helm (for Kubernetes management), and Apache Kafka for data streaming.

    2. Clone the Repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-ecommerce-analytics-platform.git
    cd ai-ecommerce-analytics-platform
    ```

    3. Set Up Environment
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    4. Build and Run Containers
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    helm install ecommerce-platform ./helm-chart
    ```
    
Usage Instructions
1. Starting the Application
    - Run the application using Docker Compose or Kubernetes as outlined in the Installation Guide.
    - Access the platformâ€™s dashboard via `http://localhost:3000` (or designated Kubernetes ingress URL).

    2. Data Ingestion
    - Use provided scripts or API endpoints to ingest customer and transactional data into the platform.

    3. Predictive Analytics and Insights
    - Customer Segmentation: Run the segmentation model through the API or scheduled Airflow tasks to classify customers.
    - Demand Forecasting: Use time-series models to analyze and predict demand trends. Results will appear in the dashboard or can be exported via API.
    - Fraud Detection: Automatically flags anomalous transactions during data processing.

    4. NLP-Driven Customer Insights
    - Sentiment Analysis: Access sentiment scores for customer reviews.
    - Topic Modeling: Identify prevalent topics in customer feedback for better service insights.
